# Chill-Out

This is the repository for my MERN stack Social media app.
To use this in your local system:
   1. Clone the repository
   2. Create a .env file and add your MONGO_URL and PORT=3001 in it
   3. In both server and client folder use the command  " npm i --legacy-peer-deps "
   4. Start the server and client individually using   "npm run start"
